### Patients' Admission Analysis
I contributed to enhancing operational efficiency at WellLife Hospital, by analyzing patient admission trends. The findings revealed a significant decline in certain diagnoses, enabling the hospital **to restrategize resource allocation toward predominant illnesses**. This optimization reduced wastage, improved patient care delivery, and ultimately led to increased revenue.
